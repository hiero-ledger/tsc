# Hiero Technical Steering Committee Meeting

**TL;DR:**   The TSC held an in-depth session focused on understanding and applying the Linux Foundation Code of Conduct, followed by updates on project transitions from Hedera to Hiero, new proposals, upcoming elections, and an open discussion on repo governance structure. A key consensus emerged to maintain standard governance rules with clear documentation of exceptions (e.g., consensus node).

## Code of Conduct

As in every meeting we start with a short notice of the [antitrust policy of Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/legal/antitrust-policy) and an introduction of our [Code of Conduct](https://www.lfdecentralizedtrust.org/code-of-conduct).

## Meeting Summary

- **Code of Conduct Review:**  
  David Boswell from the Linux Foundation presented an overview of the LF Code of Conduct, emphasizing respectful behavior, incident reporting procedures, and cultural considerations. The group discussed real-life scenarios and challenges with interpretation, particularly across cultures and organizational norms.

- **Repository Governance & Structure:**  
  Ongoing debate about maintaining a unified structure for maintainers/committers vs. supporting exceptions for large mono-repos like the Consensus Node. Proposal moving forward:
  - Default: One maintainer group, one committer group per project/repo.
  - Exceptions allowed with documented rationale and structure.
  - A team (Hendrik, Jessica, Roger, and Consensus Node maintainers) will formalize the exception handling for Consensus Node repo.

- **Project Transitions:**  
  - Nearly all projects have been transitioned from Hedera to Hiero, with 3 additional repositories pending.
  - A new proposal was introduced to onboard the “standards SDK” from Hashgraph Online. Full presentation and vote expected in the next TSC meeting.
  - Guardian project not ready yet for inclusion; will be proposed by its team when appropriate.

- **Naming Consistency:**  
  Suggestion raised to align SDK naming conventions (e.g., “Hiero SDK Java” vs. “Standards SDK”). To be discussed further with proposers.

- **Elections & Adopters:**  
  - April is nomination month for new TSC members.
  - Call for more adopter companies to participate. Hendrik encouraged submitting pull requests or reaching out for help in submitting nominations.

- **Security TSC Working Group:**  
  Jessica provided an update: initial internal alignment is underway, and external communications will follow soon in the GitHub PR.

- **Other Announcements:**  
  Hendrik announced a new product—Hashphere—built on top of the open-source Hiero infrastructure, showcasing growing ecosystem diversity.

## Key Decisions

- TSC supports a **default governance model** of one maintainer and one committer group per project/repo.
- **Exceptions**, such as for the Consensus Node repo, are permitted with clear documentation and TSC visibility.
- Upcoming vote expected on the **Hashgraph Online SDK** proposal next meeting.

## Action Items

- Finalize nominations and PRs for TSC election
- Internal alignment and public update on Security TSC Group
- Encourage more companies to submit adopter nominations via PRs
- Document exception structure for Consensus Node governance
