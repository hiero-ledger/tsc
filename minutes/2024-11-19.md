## Meeting Details:

### 1. Approval of Previous Meeting Minutes

- **Discussion:**
  - Hendrik Ebbers requested approval for the meeting minutes dated November 12th.
  - The minutes had one prior approval; Hendrik asked for a second to merge them.
  - **Action:** Alex Popowycz reviewed and approved the minutes.
- **Outcome:**
  - The meeting minutes were approved and merged into the repository.

### 2. Project Transition Updates

#### **a. Transition from Hedera to Hiero**

- **Update by Hendrik Ebbers:**
  - Significant progress has been made on the project transition checklist.
  - **Hedera Go SDK** will be transferred this week.
  - **Hedera Local Node:**
    - Deployment to npmjs is being finalized.
    - The Linux Foundation now has access to npmjs credentials.
    - Post-resolution, focus will shift to transferring **Solo** and potentially **Hedera SDK JavaScript**.
- **Discussion:**
  - **Solo Repository Transfer:**
    - **Alex Popowycz:** Sought clarification on which Solo repositories are being transferred.
    - **Hendrik Ebbers:** Confirmed focus on the public Solo repository used in GitHub Actions.
    - **Private Repositories:**
      - **Alex:** Noted the existence of private Solo repositories that may have dependencies.
      - **Richard Bair:** Suggested they could be made public.
    - **Action:** Hendrik will consult with Jeremy for clarification on public vs. private Solo repositories to ensure proper transition without compromising sensitive information.

#### **b. Transfer of Third-Party Projects**

- **How to Transfer Document:**
  - Hendrik finalized a draft document outlining the process for transferring third-party projects to Hiero.
  - **Action:** TSC members are requested to review the document for approval.
- **Project Proposal Example:**
  - Hendrik created a project proposal as a template for future submissions.
  - **Discussion Points:**
    - Importance of having a clear and straightforward onboarding process.
    - The distinction between projects suitable for direct inclusion in Hiero vs. those that should first enter the LF Deep Tech Labs for incubation.
  - **Criteria for Project Acceptance:**
    - Projects closely related to Hiero's core functionalities are preferred.
    - Emphasis on tools, frameworks, and libraries that aid application developers in building on top of Hiero.
    - **Examples:**
      - Python SDK
      - GitHub Actions for Solo network setup
  - **Action Items:**
    - TSC members to review the project proposal template.
    - Consideration of adopting a "ring model" to categorize project suitability based on proximity to core functionalities.
    - Hendrik to engage with LF representatives to clarify the transition process for projects.

### 3. GitHub Actions and Infrastructure

- **Issue:**
  - Need for powerful runners for CI/CD pipelines, especially for SDKs and performance tests.
  - **Cost Considerations:**
    - Using GitHub's own runners is significantly more expensive (~3x) than self-hosted runners.
    - Security features required are not available in GitHub's free tier.
- **Discussion:**
  - **Nathan's Input:** Even SDK projects require more powerful runners than GitHub's basic offerings.
  - **Richard Bair:** Emphasized the need to control costs and suggested that not all projects may need powerful runners.
- **Outcome:**
  - **Formation of Working Groups:**
    - **Project Onboarding Working Group:**
      - **Sponsor:** Hendrik Ebbers
      - **Focus:** Streamlining the onboarding process for new projects.
    - **Build Infrastructure and Finance Working Group:**
      - **Sponsor:** Alex Popowycz
      - **Focus:** Addressing infrastructure needs and financial implications.
    - **Voting Procedures Working Group:**
      - **Sponsor:** Richard Bair
      - **Focus:** Defining clear voting processes for governance.
  - **Decision:** The TSC voted and approved the formation of these working groups.

### 4. Technical Charter Updates

- **Issue:**
  - Clarification needed on processes not explicitly defined in the current charter (e.g., voting procedures, member removal).
- **Discussion:**
  - **Proposal:** Rather than amending the charter, create supplementary documents detailing procedures.
  - **Richard Bair:** Suggested keeping governance documents in a separate repository for clarity.
  - **Organization of Documents:**
    - Governance documents to reside in a dedicated "Governance" repository.
    - TSC materials (e.g., meeting minutes, agendas) to remain in the "TSC" repository.
  - **Action Items:**
    - Hendrik to remove duplicate charter copies and ensure a single authoritative version exists.
    - Richard to lead efforts in organizing governance documentation.
- **Outcome:**
  - Agreement to maintain the charter as-is and develop additional documents for procedural clarity.
  - Consensus on repository organization to improve document management and accessibility.
