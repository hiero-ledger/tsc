# Hiero Technical Steering Committee Meeting

**TL;DR:** Hendrik confirmed two valid nominations for the open TSC seat (May and Brandon), with voting to commence shortly. Members discussed election logistics, including tie scenarios and tooling. A proposal to create a dedicated Hiero Marketing Committee gained strong support. Final hurdles to project graduation (notably OpenSSF scorecard inclusion) were also reviewed.

## Meeting Summary

- **Quorum Tracking Improvements:** Hendrik plans to automate quorum/attendance updates via Diane’s Google Sheet and integrate this into weekly agendas.
- **TSC Election Update:**
  - Nominations for open TSC seat are now closed (May Chan and Brandon Davenport nominated).
  - Election will be conducted via Helios, as done previously.
  - Voting begins next week and lasts 6 days.
- **Election Tie Handling:**
  - Several strategies discussed: revote, coin flip, or reduced candidate runoff.
  - General consensus: revote until a winner emerges; random tie-breaking only as last resort.
- **Proposal: Hiero Marketing Committee:**
  - Purpose: Drive branding, content, social media, event presence, etc.
  - Membership to include community/TSC volunteers and marketing reps from contributing orgs.
  - Hendrik and Milan confirmed participation; Brandon invited to join.
  - A suggestion to establish a discretionary fund for the committee was well received.
- **Graduation Tracker Progress:**
  - All but 2 graduation checklist items are complete.
  - Roadblock: OpenSSF Scorecard links missing from a few project READMEs due to scores below 7.
  - TSC discussed publishing them anyway with explanatory annotations.
  - Agreement to display lower scores if improvement isn’t feasible before August graduation filing.
- **Future Actions:** Post-graduation, TSC will work to categorize Hiero subprojects by maturity level and potentially restructure GitHub orgs accordingly.

---

## Key Decisions

- Proceed with TSC election next week using Helios.
- In case of a tie, conduct additional voting rounds before considering other methods.
- Form a Hiero Marketing Committee with community and company contributors.
- Approve publishing OpenSSF Scorecard links even for projects scoring below 7, if needed.

---

## Action Items

- **Hendrik & Jessica:** Launch TSC election next week; monitor voting progress and announce results in 2 weeks.
- **Jessica:** Investigate budget options for the Hiero Marketing Committee; coordinate with LF marketing for brand kit support.
- **TSC Members:** Volunteer to join Marketing Committee; contact Hendrik or Milan.
- **Jessica/Roger:** Continue improving OpenSSF scores and add explanatory annotations where needed.
- **All TSC Members:** Review Mike’s TSC asynchronous voting proposal before next meeting.
