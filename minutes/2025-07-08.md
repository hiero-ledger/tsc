**TL;DR:** The TSC finalized adjustments to the election schedule, discussed automated quorum tracking and asynchronous voting eligibility, debated whether to revise the charter to eliminate meeting attendance requirements for voting, and introduced a formal draft for Hiero's backward compatibility policy. Work also began on a pragmatic branding kit via collaboration with LFDT.

## Active TSC member state
Based on charter:
> Any TSC member, including permanent members, that misses three (3) consecutive meetings shall be automatically suspended from eligibility to vote, i.e. no longer considered an active member, until having attended two meetings consecutively. For avoidance of doubt, the suspended TSC member shall be eligible to vote in the second consecutive meeting.
