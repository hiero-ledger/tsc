# Hiero Technical Steering Committee (TSC) Meeting

**TL;DR:**  
The TSC welcomed two newly elected members, approved the addition of two new projects (Hederium Go-based JSON-RPC relay and Hiero DID SDK for JavaScript), and discussed lessons learned from the first TSC election. Both projects were unanimously accepted into the Hiero project. Voting results were disclosed transparently, with high end-user participation noted.
