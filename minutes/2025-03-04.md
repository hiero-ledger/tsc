## Code of Conduct

As in every meeting we start with a short notice of the [antitrust policy of Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/legal/antitrust-policy) and an introduction of our [Code of Conduct](https://www.lfdecentralizedtrust.org/code-of-conduct).

## Agenda

- Vote on the minor HIP to allow removal of orphaned allowances from dissociated tokens  
- Demonstration and discussion of the blockchain-based polling tool (Hedera Form) for community engagement  
- Exploration of future technical enhancements including EVM equivalence, block streams, block nodes, state proofs, and archival/unarchiving mechanisms  
- Discussion on post quantum cryptography with emphasis on adopting Falcon signatures and transitioning legacy keys  
- Proposal to refine the HIP process by introducing an early “abstract stage” for preliminary review

## Summary

This meeting focused on reviewing a minor HIP for allowance removal and evaluating innovative approaches for online polling and technical enhancements. Key discussions included the progression toward seamless EVM equivalence, robust block stream architectures, and the integration of post quantum security measures while refining the HIP process for earlier community feedback.

## Key Decisions and Discussion Points (Condensed)

- **HIP on Allowance Removal:** Approved a minor HIP to allow removal of orphaned allowances from dissociated tokens.  
- **Online Polling Tool:** Evaluated the Hedera Form polling tool for community engagement; further legal review is needed regarding wallet requirements for official votes.  
- **Technical Enhancements:** Discussed advancing EVM equivalence with native token support, unified block streams with state proofs, and improved archival mechanisms.  
- **Post Quantum Security:** Focused on transitioning to Falcon signatures and the challenges of migrating legacy keys.  
- **HIP Process Refinement:** Proposed introducing an “abstract stage” for HIPs to obtain early high-level feedback before detailed technical proposals.
