## Meeting Summary

- **Hiero CLI Proposal:**

  - Michiel Mulders presented an updated, detailed proposal for the Hiero CLI project.
  - Covered project history, contributors, architecture, personas, pain points addressed, and vision.
  - Key updates include 12 releases since March 2024, active contributor base (8 total), TypeScript usage, Jest testing, and CLI as foundational developer tooling.
  - **Vote:** Proposal approved unanimously (6 votes in favor).
  - Next steps: Michiel to join the Hiero Community Transition Bi-Weekly meeting (joined same day due to travel schedule).

- **Graduation of Hiero Project:**

  - Official pull request for graduation submitted; early feedback positive. Expected to be reviewed in the upcoming technical meeting.

- **HIP Tracker Introduction (Richard Bair):**

  - New GitHub-based HIP tracking board created to track proposal lifecycle (draft, review, last call, approved, etc.).
  - Goal: Improve visibility, ensure timely reviews, and avoid missing proposals in TSC discussions.
  - Identified current HIPs in last call or review status; prepared three for today.

- **HIP Reviews & Votes:**

  1. **Fee Collection Account HIP**

     - New network-owned account (802) to consolidate fee collection, distributed daily to node/staking accounts.
     - Benefits: Reduced overhead, improved performance, simplified user visibility of fees, reduced block stream size.
     - **Vote:** Approved unanimously (6 votes in favor).

  2. **Add Stale Status Code HIP**

     - Adds a new transaction status for events that never achieve consensus (“stale”), enabling faster client resubmission.
     - Improves developer experience in high-throughput or test environments.
     - Presented for review; possible expedited vote to align with upcoming release 0.65 performance testing.

  3. **Simple Fees HIP**

     - Overhauls fee calculation system to use a base + extras model (similar to ordering a pizza), replacing the complex resource-based model.
     - Benefits: Easier configuration, consistent fee estimation, improved transparency for auditors and developers, reusable fee engine across mainnet, mirror node, and tools.
     - Includes new fee estimation API on mirror nodes.
     - Presented for review; aiming for a vote within two weeks.

## Key Decisions

  - Hiero CLI proposal
  - Fee Collection Account HIP

## Action Items
