# Hiero Technical Steering Committee Meeting

**TL;DR:** TSC approved two new repositories (Hiero Contracts and Hiero Ethereum Client Spec) and approved the Identity Collaboration Hub (one abstention). Discussion on a separate “Hiero Consensus Specs” repo (donated HCS specs) continued; naming and governance alignment to be finalized next week. A new centralized governance wiki for meeting agendas/minutes was introduced.

## Meeting Summary

- **Community updates & events**
  - LFDT **Maintainer Days (NYC)** and **LFDT Member Summit (NJ)** upcoming; maintainers and members encouraged to attend and coordinate a Hiero meetup.
  - **Dec 10 virtual event:** “Patchwork / Longer Form Syncing on AI Standards” (cross-foundation standards collaboration).
  - **FOSDEM (Brussels)**: Hendrik planning to attend and potentially present on Hiero; EU community members invited to coordinate.

- **HIPS status**
  - No urgent HIPS for TSC vote this week.  
  - **HIP-1313** is the closest to coming forward; additional HIPS expected soon (e.g., cutover; block streams/nodes; node rewards) in the next few weeks.

- **Project proposals (votes)**
  1. **Hiero Contracts Repository** – *Approved* (unanimous among present TSC voters).  
  2. **Hiero Ethereum Client Spec (ETH client test conformance fork)** – *Approved* (unanimous among present TSC voters).  
  3. **Identity Collaboration Hub** – *Approved* (one abstention: Richard Bair; all other present TSC voters in favor).

- **HCS specifications donation & repo structure (discussion continued)**
  - Proposal for donating Hashgraph Online HCS specifications into Hiero under a dedicated repository.
  - **Naming & neutrality:** General agreement that the repo name should be vendor-neutral (e.g., **“Hiero Consensus Specs”**). Avoid “HOL” branding in the repo name.
  - **Process alignment:** Broad support for a **separate maintainer group** (not the TSC) to steward these specs; strong interest in:
    - Maintaining continuity of existing HCS numbering/names (e.g., **HCS-1**).
    - Establishing an **index HIP** in HIPS that ratifies/pointers to each published spec (each spec may also have a small companion file in HIPS for metadata/versioning and canonical commit SHA).
  - **Open question:** Whether the specs repo should live **inside Hiero** or instead at **LFDT level** if stronger ledger-neutral positioning is required. Discussion to continue next week.

- **Governance wiki for meetings/minutes**
  - New **centralized wiki** in the governance repo for meeting agendas/minutes across Hiero communities was introduced.  
  - TSC to consider moving TSC agendas/minutes into this wiki for consistency; fuller walkthrough planned for next meeting.

## Key Decisions

- **APPROVED:** Hiero Contracts Repository.
- **APPROVED:** Hiero Ethereum Client Spec repository.
- **APPROVED:** Identity Collaboration Hub (**1 abstention** – Richard Bair).
- **PENDING:** HCS specs donation/repo. Next steps:
  - Michael Kantor to return with updated naming/governance proposal (e.g., “Hiero Consensus Specs”), including how HCS4 process maps to HIPS index ratification.
  - TSC to revisit repo placement (Hiero vs. LFDT) and finalize approach next week.
