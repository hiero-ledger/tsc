# Hiero Technical Steering Committee Meeting

**TL;DR:**  The meeting focused on the final stages of Hedera project transitions into Hiero, progress on open meeting minutes, an in-depth walkthrough of the proposed "Hiero Enterprise Java" project, and a key discussion on the governance and incorporation of community-driven standards like those from Hashgraph Online. Voting on the Enterprise Java project is postponed pending further review.

## Code of Conduct

As in every meeting we start with a short notice of the [antitrust policy of Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/legal/antitrust-policy) and an introduction of our [Code of Conduct](https://www.lfdecentralizedtrust.org/code-of-conduct).

## Agenda

- Approve previous minutes 
- Update on project transition (https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero/blob/main/transition.md & https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero/blob/main/community-transition.md)
- Update on election process (https://github.com/hiero-ledger/governance/blob/main/elections/elections.md & https://github.com/hiero-ledger/governance/blob/main/elections/ADOPTERS.md)
- Presentation of OpenElements/hiero-enterprise-java as possible Hiero project (https://github.com/hiero-ledger/tsc/issues/111)
- Discussion: Is the Application HIP process the correct workflow to SDK projects and other standards (like Hashgraph Online)
- Dual publishing for SDKs (under 2 com.hedera and org.hiero namespace) for a more easy migration
- Any other business (AOB)

## Meeting Summary

- **Meeting Minutes:** Four sets of minutes are still pending approval; focus remains on finalizing the January 21st record.
- **Project Transition:** Migration of Hedera-origin projects to Hiero is nearly complete; the last remaining project, "Solo," will be finalized by Thursday. Next TSC meeting may celebrate full transition.
- **Community Projects:** Discussion of integrating community contributions like the Hashgraph Online Standards SDK. The SDK is technically ready but the debate centers on the right governance model.
- **TSC Election Process:** Two new TSC seats will be introduced — Contributor and End User. A GitHub-based nomination process has been developed and supporting media is being created for transparency.
- **New Blog Platform:** A markdown-based blog system is launching for the Hyro.org website to enable community-driven content publishing.
- **Project Presentation – Hiero Enterprise Java:**
  - Presented by Hendrik Ebbers
  - Aims to abstract the core Java SDK into enterprise frameworks (Spring Boot, MicroProfile)
  - Provides dependency injection, configuration ease, mirror node integration, and test support
  - Supported by multiple contributors and planned for official proposal vote in the next meeting
- **Governance Discussion – Standards Integration:**
  - Explored how to formally integrate community-created standards (e.g., HCS-01, HCS-20)
  - Discussed whether these standards require formal HIP processes or could live in markdown files with lighter governance
  - General agreement: Standards can be managed in Hiero repos with version control and lighter governance than HIPs

## Presentations

### Hiero Enterprise Java (Presented by Hendrik Ebbers)
- **Overview:** Enterprise-friendly abstraction over the Java SDK, simplifying development in Spring Boot and MicroProfile.
- **Features:** Dependency injection, mirror node access, transaction orchestration, and full testing support with solo integration.
- **Status:** Active project with >10 contributors, extensive testing, and several releases. Positioned as middleware rather than an SDK or application.

## Key Decisions

- No formal votes held, but there was general consensus to:
  - Move the "Hiero Enterprise Java" project to a formal vote in a future meeting
  - Continue exploring integration of standards and define a clear governance path that balances decentralization with efficient workflows

## Action Items

| Item | Owner | Deadline |
|------|-------|----------|
| Finalize and approve open meeting minutes (esp. Jan 21) | TSC Members | Before next TSC meeting |
| Finalize project transition of "Solo" | Roger & Andrew | Thursday, April 17 |
| Distribute media for TSC election nomination process | Marketing Team | ASAP (likely this week) |
| Share and review election tooling and workflow | Jessica Gonzalez | Before election launch |
| Schedule a vote for Enterprise Java integration | Hendrik / Chairs | Next TSC Meeting |
| Continue standards governance discussion (HIPS vs lightweight standards) | TSC Members | Next TSC Meeting |
