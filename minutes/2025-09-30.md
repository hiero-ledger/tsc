# Hiero Technical Steering Committee Meeting

**TL;DR:** TSC approved **HIP-1261 (Simple fees)** and the **homebrew-tools** project proposal (to distribute CLI tools via Homebrew) with a strong emphasis on key-management and security education. Presentation of **HIP-1200 (hinTS threshold signatures)** was deferred to next week. Good-first-issue guidance for Hacktoberfest is in place.

## Meeting Summary
 
- **Previous minutes:** Already approved and merged; no action required.  
- **HIP-1261 (Simple fees):**  
  - Brief discussion on using **enums vs. strings** for “extra” fee types. Flexibility (strings) vs. compile-time safety/compactness (enums) noted.  
  - **Vote held — unanimous “Yes”** from TSC members present.  
  - Follow-up: Hendrik will add a comment on the PR regarding enum vs. string; maintainers to respond.  
- **HIP-1200 (hinTS threshold signature scheme):**  
  - Presenter (Mark Blackman) requested to defer one week to finalize an abstract change.  
  - TSC agreed to hear the presentation at the next meeting.  
- **Project proposal: `homebrew-tools` (Homebrew tap):**  
  - Robust discussion on **AI-era supply-chain risks** (e.g., prompt-injection via agents) and the importance of **safe key management** in CLI tools.  
  - Consensus: proceed with Homebrew distribution while **hardening CLI workflows** (e.g., avoid storing private keys on disk, require explicit user approval for sensitive actions).  
  - **Vote held — unanimous “Yes”.**  
  - Next steps assigned to Nathan/Roger (with Jessica) to bootstrap repo and process.  
- **Hacktoberfest & good-first-issues:**  
  - New **“good-first-issue” guidance** and labeling workflow published: use **“good first issue candidate”** → curate in a **weekly Monday triage** → promote to **“good first issue.”**  
  - Global contributing docs updated (fork/PR lifecycle, DCO/GPG, conventional commits).  
  - ~79 candidate issues identified across repos; maintainers invited to participate in the curation meetings.

## Key Decisions

- **HIP-1261 (Simple fees) — APPROVED** (unanimous).  
- **Create `homebrew-tools` project/repo — APPROVED** (unanimous).

---

## Action Items

- **HIP-1261 follow-up:**  
  - *Hendrik Ebbers* — post question in PR thread on **enum vs. string** for fee “extras”.  
  - *Maintainers (incl. Richard/Keith)* — reply in HIP-1261 thread; finalize approach in the spec.
- **Homebrew tap setup:**  
  - *Nathan Klick & Roger Barker* (with *Jessica*) — create `homebrew-tools` repo, establish code-ownership, licensing checks for dependencies, and release process.
- **CLI security hardening:**  
  - *Hiero CLI maintainers* — implement safer key-management practices (e.g., avoid persisting private keys to the filesystem; require explicit user confirmation for spend-like operations) prior to distributing via Homebrew tap.
- **Hacktoberfest curation:**  
  - *All maintainers* — convert **“good first issue candidate”** to **“good first issue”** through Monday triage; keep issues current and newcomer-friendly.
