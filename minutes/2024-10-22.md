## Code of Conduct

As in every meeting we start with a short notice of the [antitrust policy of Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/legal/antitrust-policy) and an introduction of our [Code of Conduct](https://www.lfdecentralizedtrust.org/code-of-conduct).

## Agenda

- Approve previous minutes (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v1U40_yeDEMYIZeCIsQbthZOreprzsw_rg0304pZkxU/edit#heading=h.3fd83qft1mx)
- Michael Heinrichs wants to present a HIP: https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-improvement-proposal/pull/1049
- We need to come back to the hip from last week that Mark Blackman presented: https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-improvement-proposal/blob/main/HIP/hip-1046.md
- How is the HIP workflow for the TSC?
- Discuss the two missing points at https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero/blob/main/howto-transfer.md
- Brandon Davenport attended the meeting last week and would like to help us create the minutes for the TSC meetings. He has a workflow (with AI support) that he already uses in other groups (sample: https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-wallet-connect/wiki/Working-Group-Meeting-%E2%80%90-July-29th-2024). He would like to discuss with us how he can help with creating minutes.
- Any other business (AOB)

## Minutes

- Rules check: Alex and George have missed 3 consecutive meetings, and thus quorum is made up of 4 members, 3 of which are present. We therefore have quorum and can vote
- PROPOSAL: Use of “org.hiero” as the Maven Central Group ID and the @hiero npmjs.org organization name.
  - VOTE: YES (Stoyan, Hendrik, Richard)
- PROPOSAL: If hiero is unavailable on npmjs, then use heiro-ledger
  - VOTE: YES (Stoyan, Hendrik, Richard)
- PROPOSAL: HIP-1049
  - VOTE: YES (Stoyan, Hendrik, Richard)
- PROPOSAL: HIP-1046
  - VOTE: YES (Stoyan, Hendrik, Richard)
- Decision to defer HIP workflow discussion to a future call when Leemon is available.
- Brandon presented his idea for how we can use AI to help with meeting minutes. He has used this technique for several other projects in the Hedera ecosystem (wallet connect, etc).

  Given a transcript, feed the transcript into OpenAI with specific prompts to create the meeting minutes
  Could we commit the transcript to a repo and then let a github action automatically generate the resulting meeting minutes?
  Brandon says that in the end a human needs to hand-edit and tweak the final results, so automation isn’t quite there yet.
  Concern is, what if we have a meeting where Brandon does not attend? If we have some toolchain that automates this, then we can make sure the minutes are not missed.
  Action: Diane to find out how to get transcripts of LF zoom meetings (or we have to add an AI agent to the calls to record it). We can then feed this to Brandon. We’ll try this out and see how it works for us.
- Diane sharing early view of which conference we will attempt to attend as Hiero
- Hendrik provided a sneak peek of some looks into possible mascots for Hiero
