# Hiero Technical Steering Committee Meeting

**TL;DR:** The committee reviewed two major HIPS: one introducing a more precise throttling mechanism for smart contracts, replacing gas-per-second limits with measured Ops cost, and another enabling smart contracts to schedule other smart contract calls. Discussions also touched on governance documentation, backward compatibility enforcement, and repository structure improvements.

## Code of Conduct

As in every meeting we start with a short notice of the [antitrust policy of Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/legal/antitrust-policy) and an introduction of our [Code of Conduct](https://www.lfdecentralizedtrust.org/code-of-conduct).

## Meeting Summary

- **HIP on Precise Smart Contract Throttling (Richard Bair):**
  - Replaces the current crude gas-per-second throttling with a model based on actual execution cost (“Ops cost”).
  - Enables significantly higher throughput for smart contracts (potential 10x improvement).
  - Removes the “80% minimum charge” model to align more closely with Ethereum’s behavior.
  - Enables better predictability for gas usage and cost for developers.
  - Includes backend-only throttling based on actual work done, preserving network stability.
  - Future implications include better support for hook contracts and more performant relayer patterns.

- **HIP on Generalized Scheduled Smart Contract Call:**
  - Introduces a system contract API that lets smart contracts schedule future invocations of themselves or others.
  - Enables complex workflows such as vesting, DAO automation, rebalancing, and more.
  - Contracts can check execution capacity per second and dynamically adjust scheduling logic.
  - Considered a novel and unique feature compared to other networks.

- **Governance Discussion:**
  - Reviewed a draft for backward compatibility guidelines.
  - Acknowledged the need to structure such policies as normative and actionable.
  - Discussed whether such documents should live in the governance repo or project repo.
  - Consideration given to establishing a `guidelines/` folder within governance repo for clarity and consistency.
  - Next steps include aligning these policies with maturity states like "Graduated" or "Incubating" projects.

- **Action on Charter Documents:**
  - Noted duplication of the charter across two repositories (Hiero and Governance).
  - Jessica Gonzalez to migrate approved legal changes to the correct governance repo and clean up duplicates.
  - Further revisions to charter pending legal re-approval.

## Presentations

- **Richard Bair:** Detailed walk-through of precise smart contract throttling HIP with architectural diagrams and performance benchmarks.
- **Richard Bair (on behalf of Mark Blackman and Michael Tinker):** Presented the HIP for generalized scheduled smart contract calls.

---

## Key Decisions

- No votes were taken, but the following agreements were reached:
  - Proceed with documentation and community review of both HIPs.
  - Add architectural diagrams to relevant HIPs for clarity.
  - Move forward on standardizing the governance and backward compatibility documentation within a `guidelines/` structure.

## Active TSC member state
Based on charter:
> Any TSC member, including permanent members, that misses three (3) consecutive meetings shall be automatically suspended from eligibility to vote, i.e. no longer considered an active member, until having attended two meetings consecutively. For avoidance of doubt, the suspended TSC member shall be eligible to vote in the second consecutive meeting.
