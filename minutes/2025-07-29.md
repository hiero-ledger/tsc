## TSC Attendees

## Guests

As every Hiero meeting the TSC meeting is a public meeting and everybody can attend it.
You can find all the information about the TSC meetings and all other Hiero meetings in our [public calender](https://zoom-lfx.platform.linuxfoundation.org/meetings/hiero?view=week).

## Code of Conduct

As in every meeting we start with a short notice of the [antitrust policy of Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/legal/antitrust-policy)
and an introduction of our [Code of Conduct](https://www.lfdecentralizedtrust.org/code-of-conduct).

## Active TSC member state
Based on charter:
> Any TSC member, including permanent members, that misses three (3) consecutive meetings shall be automatically suspended from eligibility to vote, i.e. no longer considered an active member, until having attended two meetings consecutively. For avoidance of doubt, the suspended TSC member shall be eligible to vote in the second consecutive meeting.
