# Hiero Technical Steering Committee Meeting

**TL;DR:** The TSC voted to migrate the Hashgraph Online standards SDK into Hiero as the "Hiero HCS SDK (JS)" and agreed to a 12-day nomination phase for the vacant TSC seat. The committee also reached consensus on documentation strategy: maintainers retain freedom over tooling, while a standardized branding kit will be developed.

## Meeting Summary

- **TSC Election Process:** A new TSC seat remains vacant. Hendrik presented a timeline and process involving:
  - 12-day nomination phase
  - Nominees must submit a markdown PR with their qualifications
  - The TSC will review nominations and vote over 6 days
- **SDK Naming & Migration:**
  - The committee debated between "Hiero HOL SDK" and "Hiero HCS SDK."
  - Concerns raised over clarity, brand continuity, and governance structure.
  - Final consensus: `hiero-hcs-sdk-js` was approved by vote, contingent on maintaining reference to Hashgraph Online in documentation.
- **Documentation Standardization:**
  - Strong consensus for allowing projects to choose their own documentation tooling.
  - TSC endorsed creating a branding kit (logos, fonts, style guide) to unify look and feel.
  - The Docs Working Group will own this and bring final recommendations to the TSC.
- **Meeting Participation:** Jessica Gonzalez reminded attendees of the importance of regular participation in working groups, especially SDK and docs meetings.

## Key Decisions

- Motion passed: Rename and migrate Hashgraph Online SDK
- Proceed with TSC election process as proposed (12-day nomination â†’ 6-day voting)
- TSC supports approach 1 for documentation: maintainers choose their tools; Hiero provides branding and templates
