# Hiero Technical Steering Committee Meeting

**TL;DR:** The TSC unanimously approved **HIP-1200 (hinTS threshold signature scheme)**. The committee reviewed **HIP-1300 (jumbo transactions for privileged accounts)** and **HIP-1299 (node account ID change rules)**—no votes taken; members will comment on the PRs. The group also aligned on improving **community call** infrastructure and agenda visibility.

## Meeting Summary
  
- **HIP-1200 (hinTS threshold signature scheme):**  
  - Motion raised and seconded; quorum confirmed (7/9).  
  - **Vote result:** Approved **7–0**
- **HIP-1300 (jumbo transactions for privileged accounts):**  
  - Motivation: Council multi-sig transactions can exceed the 6 KB limit; proposal allows **privileged accounts (e.g., 0.0.2, 0.0.50)** to submit transactions up to the existing “jumbo” cap.  
  - Discussion points:  
    - Consider broadening beyond just 0.0.2 and 0.0.50 to **all privileged accounts** (A. Popowycz).  
    - **Risk/perf:** Considered negligible; volume is low and precedents exist with jumbo EVM transactions.  
    - Applies to **all transaction types** when signed by those privileged accounts.  
  - **Next step:** No vote today; members to comment on the PR with the broader-scope suggestion.  
- **HIP-1299 (node account ID rules in the Dynamic Address Book):**  
  - Clarifies who may update a node’s associated **account ID**, and behavior in edge cases (receiver-sig-required, zero funds, deletions, fines vs. rewards, signature requirements from node operator vs. account owner).  
  - **Blast-radius discussion:** Proposal favors **one unique account per node** to avoid multiple nodes going offline if a shared account drains unexpectedly. Some operators prefer reuse for treasury simplicity; suggestion to revisit policy rationale in PR feedback.  
  - **Companion/forward work:** An upcoming HIP will let transactions specify **node IDs (list)** instead of a node **account ID**, improving reliability for in-flight/scheduled txns and preventing dishonest nodes from claiming intake rewards on gossiped txns.  
  - **Next step:** No vote; continue discussion in the PR.  
- **AOB – Community calls infrastructure:**  
  - New monthly calls planned: **Identity** and **Mirror/Block node**.  
  - Challenges: Discoverability of recordings (OpenProfile/LFDT calendar) and lack of a central place for **agendas** and links.  
  - Options discussed:  
    - Use **governance repo** to host agendas (preferred over creating a new repo).  
    - Improve **org landing page**/resources; possibly a simple **Markdown “start here”** page with calendar, OpenProfile, and call links; consider a short hiero.org redirect to it.  
  - **Next step:** Jessica to explore how other LF projects do this and propose an initial structure/permissions; Keith to coordinate with SDK collab hub and proceed with standing up the two new calls.

## Key Decisions

- **Approved:** HIP-1200 – hinTS threshold signature scheme (7–0).  
- **Deferred / Discussion continues:**  
  - HIP-1300 – Consider broadening jumbo-tx eligibility to all privileged accounts; comment on PR.  
  - HIP-1299 – Continue feedback regarding unique node account per node and upcoming node-ID-in-txn approach.  
- **Operational:** Proceed to improve community-call agenda visibility (likely via governance repo) and update org landing page resources.
