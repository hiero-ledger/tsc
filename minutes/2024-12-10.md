## Minutes
- The existing 3rd party project documentation was accepted "as-is" to be updated as gaps are identified and clarifications are needed. It was recommended that the process remain simple and lightweight.
- Documentation - there was discussion on how we accelerate the documentation efforts, extending beyond the README documents of individual repos. A recommendation was made to set up documentation working groups for specific subject matter areas such as DevOps and Release Engineering to foster "best practices" in those areas.
  - Alex Popowycz volunteered to spearhead DevOps documentation contributions, leveraging existing Hedera documentation as a foundation.
- Under (AOB) the topic of creating future timeline of events and significant milestones be developed and published. The intention to provide visibility into the overall project direction.
