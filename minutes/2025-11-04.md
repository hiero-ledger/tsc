# Hiero Technical Steering Committee Meeting

**TL;DR:** The TSC approved **HIP-1299** (7–1). The committee discussed adopting **X402 “Payment Required”** patterns on Hedera/Hiero, aligned on exploring an open-source facilitator template, and assigned outreach to the X402 group. Prior meeting minutes remain pending final review/approval.

## Meeting Summary

- **Prior minutes:** PRs for **Oct 21** and **Oct 28** meetings are open in the TSC repo and need final review/approval by members.
- **HIPs:** The board was reviewed. The only item at “Ready to Vote” was **HIP-1299**.
- **Vote – HIP-1299:** Conducted live (async vote was deferred). **Result: Approved 7–1.**
- **X402 overview (Stoyan):**  
  - X402 revives HTTP **402 Payment Required** for paid APIs; clients/agents receive a 402 with payment instructions, sign an **EIP-712** message, and the **facilitator** settles on-chain; access is then granted.  
  - Opportunity for Hedera/Hiero to implement or interoperate (e.g., supporting HBAR and stablecoins) and to provide a simple, reusable facilitator template for developers.  
  - Related/adjacent efforts to consider alongside X402: **Cloudflare “Deferred”** and **Circo “Batched”** standards.
- **Discussion highlights:**  
  - **Go-to-market & adoption:** Resource owners will want easy, chain-agnostic options; a **templated, clonable facilitator gateway** (with clear deploy guides, e.g., Cloudflare) could accelerate adoption.  
  - **Ecosystem fit:** Hedera’s performance/fees seen as a strong technical match; encourage multi-chain support so users can pay from where they already hold funds.  
  - **Standards participation:** Desire for Hiero/Hedera representation in the emerging X402 community to ensure inclusive design and compatibility.  
  - **Implementations observed:** Hgraph and community collaborators have early facilitator work; MCP tooling from Hgraph enables LLM agents to interact with Hedera services—complementary to X402-style paid API access.

- **AOB:** Reminder to monitor and participate in **hiero-ledger org discussions** on GitHub.

## Presentations

**X402 “Payment Required” for paid APIs (Stoyan Panayotov)**  
- Goal: Enable human/agent clients to pay for API calls using standard HTTP flows plus cryptographic signing, with an on-chain facilitator handling settlement.  
- Flow: Client → resource server (402) → client signs → server → facilitator → on-chain settlement → access granted.  
- Fit for Hiero/Hedera: Provide an **open-source facilitator template** supporting HBAR and stablecoins; consider discovery/multi-currency selection; align with agentic use cases and existing MCP tools.

---

## Key Decisions

- **HIP-1299 approved (7–1).**  
- **Direction:** Explore publishing an **open-source, templated X402 facilitator/gateway** under the Hiero org (no formal vote taken; broad support expressed).  
- **Standards engagement:** Proceed with outreach to the X402 group to understand membership/participation paths.

**Action Items**
- **All TSC members:** Review and approve the **Oct 21** and **Oct 28** meeting minutes PRs in the TSC repo.  
- **Hendrik & Jessica:** Document and share the **asynchronous voting process** so future HIP votes can run async when needed.  
- **Michael Kantor:** **Reach out** to the X402 organization/foundation and **report back** on how Hiero/Hedera can participate.  
- **(Optional next step)** Stoyan and interested collaborators: Draft a brief comparing **X402**, **Deferred**, and **Batched** patterns to scope facilitator requirements (not assigned by vote).
