## Code of Conduct

As in every meeting, we start with a short notice of the [antitrust policy of Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/legal/antitrust-policy) and an introduction of our [Code of Conduct](https://www.lfdecentralizedtrust.org/code-of-conduct).

## Agenda

1. Approval of Previous Meeting Minutes
2. Discussion on Versioning within Hiero (Postponed)
3. Migration of Hedera Documentation
4. Transfer of Third-Party Projects
5. Presentation of Python Mini SDK by Nadine Loepfe

## Summary

The Hiero Technical Steering Committee discussed several key topics, including the migration of Hedera documentation, the transfer of third-party projects, and the introduction of a new Python Mini SDK by Nadine Loepfe. The migration of documentation requires splitting Hedera-specific content before transferring to Hiero. The transfer process for third-party projects is being streamlined in coordination with LFDT. Nadine's Python Mini SDK aims to engage the community through contributions, offering a native Python interface to the Hedera network. The meeting concluded with action items assigned to various members and plans to revisit postponed topics in the next meeting.

## Detailed Minutes

### 1. Approval of Previous Meeting Minutes

- **Hendrik Ebbers** has approved the pull request for the minutes of the last meeting.
- **Alex Popowycz** agreed to review and approve the minutes after the meeting.

### 2. Discussion on Versioning within Hiero (Postponed)

- Discussion was postponed to the next meeting.
- The topic includes adopting semantic versioning and defining best practices for all projects, especially those migrating from Hedera to Hiero.
- Hendrik noted the possibility of starting with version 1.0.0 for projects under Hiero.

### 3. Migration of Hedera Documentation

- **Hendrik** raised concerns about the complexity of migrating the Hedera documentation to Hiero.
- The documentation contains both general information and Hedera-specific content (e.g., testnet details, hardware requirements).
- **Alex** suggested splitting the documentation to separate Hedera-specific content before transferring it to Hiero.
- This approach would prevent confusion and maintain clarity between Hiero and Hedera documentation.
- **Hendrik** will lead the effort to determine the best way to accomplish this split.

### 4. Transfer of Third-Party Projects

- **Hendrik** updated the committee on creating a transfer document outlining the workflow for projects to be transferred to Hiero.
- He created a sample project proposal to illustrate the process.
- Coordination with LFDT is ongoing to streamline the process and reduce redundant approvals.
- A discussion with LFDT is scheduled for their next meeting, with more information expected in two weeks.

### 5. Presentation of Python Mini SDK by Nadine Loepfe

- **Nadine Loepfe** presented the Python Mini SDK she developed.

#### Features:

- **Account Management**: Create and fund accounts on the Hedera network.
- **Token Operations**: Create, associate, and transfer tokens.
- **Transactions**: Send HBAR to other accounts.
- **Queries**: Retrieve transaction and token details.

#### Architecture:

- **Modules**: Organized into `account`, `client`, `crypto`, `tokens`, `transactions`, `query`, and `proto` files.
- **Client Communication**: Handles communication with the Hedera network via gRPC calls.
- **Extensibility**: Designed to be easily extended by the community.
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Limited to essential packages like `cryptography`, `grpcio`, and `protobuf`.

#### Community Engagement:

- **GitHub Issues**: Created detailed issues, including "good first issues," to guide contributors.
- **Examples and Testing**:
  - Provided example scripts for common operations.
  - Implemented testing via GitHub Actions using Hedera Solo, allowing contributors to test without personal testnet accounts.
- **Documentation**: Included comprehensive readme files and comments to facilitate understanding and contributions.

#### Discussion:

- **Alex** commended Nadine on the project's structure and community-friendly approach.
- He inquired about maintaining feature parity with other SDKs like Hedera's HAPI SDK.
- **Nadine** explained that the SDK is based on the official Hedera protobufs, making it straightforward to identify and implement missing features.
- **Leemon Baird** suggested ensuring the SDK supports all fields, including newly added ones in the protobufs.
- **Hendrik** mentioned the possibility of integrating checks into the TCK (Technology Compatibility Kit) to automatically identify any missing fields or updates.
- **Nadine** agreed to add notes in the GitHub issues to remind contributors to check the latest protobufs for updates.
