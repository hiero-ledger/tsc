## Agenda

- Approve previous minutes (https://github.com/hiero-ledger/tsc/pull/69)
- We need to define if we want to use semantic version for all Hiero projects and what we will use as version for the first release per project
- How should we handle the docs project. Should it be "just migrated" or should we split it first?
- Review of the documents for transfer 3rdParty project ([transfer doc](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero/blob/main/howto-transfer.md) and [sample proposal](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/tsc/issues/67))
- Nadine will give an introduction to the [Python (Mini) SDK](https://github.com/nadineloepfe/hedera_sdk_python)
- Any other business (AOB)

## Minutes
- Versioning was discussed and it was recommended that semantic versioning be used (major.minor.patch) but leave the versioning decision at the repo / maintainer level.
- Documentation
  - Any contributed documentation (e.g. services code) should have any specific implementation details removed. It is recommended that deployments based off a particular codebase build upon the generic documentation, enriched with local implementation details.
  - Any dependencies or references in the documentation must be non-deployment specific
- Independent (3rd party) project transfers
  - Requested that TSC members review the initial draft for acceptance at the next TSC meeting
- Nadine provided an overview of the current state of the Python (Mini) SDK. She provide some background on the code including how this compares with the existing Python SDK . She highlighted how the code was organized to allow for easy participation by independent developers to contribute.
