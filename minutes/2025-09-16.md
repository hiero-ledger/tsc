# Hiero Technical Steering Committee Meeting

**TL;DR:** A shorter working session focused on (1) “Hiero turns one” announcements and the Sept 17 LFDT webinar, (2) HIP board housekeeping (removing an already-deployed unified transaction format HIP from the tracker), and (3) the ongoing TSC election—plans to boost voter outreach and likely Q&A with nominees on Thursday’s community call.

## Meeting Summary

- **Hiero @ 1 year:**  
  - Noted concurrent LFDT one-year meetup and tomorrow’s webinar “One Year of Hiero – Celebrating Open Collaboration and Neutral Governance” (Sept 17).
  - Hedera blog “Hiero Turns One: Graduation and Growth” highlighted for context.
  - LFDT blog post marking the foundation’s first year referenced.
- **HIPs:**  
  - **“Simple Fees” HIP:** Keith is addressing comments; expects to push a new draft on Sept 17 and requested agenda time for next Tuesday (Sept 23).  
  - **Unified transaction format HIP:** Mark flagged an item on the board (listed as HIP-1128 in the tracker) that was already deployed prior to the TSC voting process. Consensus: treat under the old process and remove it from the current tracker (done during the call). _Note for records:_ the public HIP catalog lists HIP-1127 “Unified transaction record format.”
- **Elections:**  
  - **Voting window:** in progress through Sept 21; results to be announced in next week’s TSC.  
  - **Comms & turnout:** Milan urged direct outreach to all eligible voters; team agreed to amplify reminders across Discord/Slack/GitHub Discussions and consider Hedera social amplification.  
  - **Eligibility clarity:** May suggested ensuring public election materials explicitly state “maintainers of graduated projects are eligible voters.” (This is consistent with the elections policy; ensure it’s prominent in public-facing docs.)  
- **AOB & adjourn:** No additional topics; early adjournment.

## Key Decisions

- **Unified transaction format HIP** (board item labeled 1128): Treated as pre-TSC-voting era work; **removed from the current HIP tracker** (no re-approval required).  
- **Schedule request:** Tentative slot to present the “Simple Fees” HIP on Sept 23, 2025, pending updated draft submission on Sept 17.
