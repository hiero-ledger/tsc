## Code of Conduct

As in every meeting we start with a short notice of the [antitrust policy of Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/legal/antitrust-policy) and an introduction of our [Code of Conduct](https://www.lfdecentralizedtrust.org/code-of-conduct).

## Agenda
1. Approval of Previous Minutes
2. Project Transition Status (Local Node, licensing remediation)
3. Review of Several HIPs:
   - HIP-1037 (Documentation improvements in Protobuf specifications)
   - HIP for Zero-Cost Ethereum Transaction on Success (HIP number to be confirmed)
   - HIP for Allowing Setting of EVM Address by EOA (HIP-1082 discussion)
   - Additional HIPs (partially discussed, to be continued next session)
4. Discussion on Proposed Roadmap for Next Year (brief mention, postponed)
5. Third-Party Project Transfer Proposal
6. OpenRewrite and Migration Topics (time permitting, postponed)
7. Any Other Business

## Summary of the Meeting

During this meeting, the TSC approved HIP-1037, which adds extensive documentation to the Protobuf specifications, and a HIP proposing zero-cost Ethereum transactions on success, reducing operational friction for JSON-RPC relay operators. The committee also began an in-depth discussion on a HIP to allow accounts to set their EVM address post-creation, a crucial step for compatibility with certain Ethereum-based contract use cases. Due to the complexity, final votes and decisions on this HIP and related proposals were deferred to the next session. The TSC confirmed the cancellation of the upcoming holiday meetings and will reconvene in January 2025.

## Detailed Minutes

**1. Approval of Previous Minutes**  
- The TSC reviewed pending pull requests for meeting minutes from previous sessions.   

**2. Project Transition Status (Local Node)**  
- Hendrik Ebbers reported progress on transitioning Local Node into Hiero governance.  
- A license remediation issue was discovered involving a specific JavaScript library. Hendrik and Nana plan to address this soon.  
- Long-term strategy: Eventually deprecate Local Node in favor of Solo if Solo achieves ease-of-use parity. Local Node remains critical for certain integrations and tests at present.

**3. Review of Several HIPs**

   a. **HIP-1037 (Protobuf Documentation Improvement)**  
   - Richard Bair introduced HIP-1037.  
   - This HIP provides extensive documentation for all Protobuf fields, offering a “specification as code” approach.  
   - A style guide is included to standardize wording.  
   - The HIP was unanimously approved by TSC members. Minor comments included ensuring alignment with future naming conventions and the Hiro transition.  
   **Vote:** All TSC members approved.

   b. **Zero-Cost Ethereum Transaction on Success**  
   - Richard Bair explained a HIP (number not explicitly stated in transcript) that removes the need for JSON-RPC relay operators to pay a fee for Ethereum transactions that successfully charge their intended payer.  
   - Currently, relay operators pay a small fee for every transaction, even when the user has enough balance. The proposed change only charges the relay if the transaction fails due diligence checks or the payer cannot cover costs at consensus.  
   - This change aligns the economics with other EVM networks, simplifying business models for relay operators.  
   **Vote:** Unanimous approval from all TSC members.

   c. **Allowing the Setting of EVM Address by EOA (HIP-1082)**  
   - Discussion initiated by Richard Bair, Nana, and Georgi.  
   - Background: Ethereum addresses are tied directly to a single key. On Hedera/Hiero, accounts can rotate keys and have complex keys, complicating EVM compatibility, especially with `ECRecover`.  
   - The challenge: Some smart contracts rely on `ECRecover` to authenticate users, expecting a stable EVM address. Hedera’s flexible key system can produce mismatches.  
   - The proposed solution: Allow existing accounts to set (or “fix”) their EVM address post-creation. This is crucial for compatibility with certain Ethereum-based contracts and avoids forcing users to recreate accounts.  
   - Complexities include ensuring secure proofs that the address is truly owned, preventing arbitrary address assignment, and considering future key rotations.  
   - Georgi suggested clarifying that `ECRecover` isn’t broken but that matching `ECRecover` results with the account’s “public” representation is the core issue.  
   - More revisions needed. No vote was taken. Discussion to continue in January.

**4. Roadmap and Other Topics**  
- The TSC briefly mentioned Diane Mueller’s proposed 2025 roadmap but postponed deeper discussion due to time constraints.  
- A third-party project transfer proposal was introduced but not fully discussed.  
- OpenRewrite and migration from Hedera SDKs to Hiro also postponed.

**5. Scheduling**  
- The December 24th and December 31st TSC meetings are canceled due to holidays. The next TSC meeting is scheduled for January 7, 2025.

## Materials
- Review of HIP-1037 (https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-improvement-proposal/pull/1037)
