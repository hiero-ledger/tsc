# Hiero Technical Steering Committee

**TL;DR:** The TSC approved the HIP on Quiescence, a feature enabling networks with low transaction throughput to reduce unnecessary block creation, bandwidth, and storage usage. The committee also discussed org structure (no split; projects to remain under Hiero Ledger), project graduation progress, upcoming maintainer elections, and the process for onboarding critical cryptography projects.

## Code of Conduct

As in every meeting we start with a short notice of the [antitrust policy of Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/legal/antitrust-policy) and an introduction of our [Code of Conduct](https://www.lfdecentralizedtrust.org/code-of-conduct).

## Meeting Summary

- **Housekeeping**

  - Reminder: All Hiero meetings are public, recorded, and operate under the Linux Foundation Code of Conduct and Antitrust Policy.
  - Hendrik noted strong attendance and encouraged broader community participation.

- **HIP Presentation: Quiescence** (Lazar Petrovic, with contributions from Richard Bair & Leemon Baird)

  - Purpose: Enable networks with very low transaction volumes (solo/dev/test networks or small deployments) to stop producing unnecessary blocks when idle.
  - Benefits:

    - Significant storage and bandwidth savings.
    - Faster response to the first incoming transaction (since no cycles wasted on empty events).
    - No negative impact on performance for high-throughput networks like Hedera.

  - Technical details:

    - Network stops producing empty events when no transactions exist.
    - Consensus resumes immediately upon receiving a transaction.
    - Maintains block integrity (last block is always closed).
    - Detecting node failures during quiescence relies on connection monitoring.

  - Clarifications:

    - Not opt-in; default behavior and beneficial across contexts.
    - Gaps between blocks possible (e.g., months), but cryptographic hashes ensure chain continuity.

- **Vote on Quiescence HIP**

  - Unanimous YES vote by all TSC members present.
  - HIP approved and will move forward.

- **Org Structure Discussion** (Jessica Gonzalez, with Keith Kowal, Richard Bair, Diane Mueller, and Hendrik Ebbers)

  - Decision: No org split; ecosystem projects will be adopted under Hiero Ledger.
  - Considerations:

    - Security standards (e.g., OpenSSF compliance, maintainers/README requirements).
    - Budget for tooling (Step Security, Snyk, engineering support).
    - Guidelines for project proposals being developed to avoid onboarding inactive/dead projects.

  - Path for new/immature projects: may first join LFDT Labs with a community steward, then graduate into Hiero Ledger when ready.
  - Action: Jessica drafting governance guidelines with minimum criteria (currently in progress).

- **Graduation Progress Update** (Hendrik Ebbers & Jessica Gonzalez)

  - Current status: Hiero is the first LFDT project pursuing graduation under the new process.
  - Challenges: Unlike single-repo projects, Hiero spans many repos, requiring broader compliance checks.
  - Additional data requested by LFDT Tech Committee (OpenSSF scorecards, LFX metrics, governance diagrams).
  - Updated PR with expanded details underway; further updates pending.
  - Voting expected soon once feedback addressed.

- **Maintainer Election** (Milan Wiercx van Rhijn & Hendrik Ebbers)

  - Next election concerns **maintainer seat currently held by Georgi**.
  - Timeline discussion postponed to next week (due to graduation workload).

- **Cryptography Project (TSS)** (Mark Blackman)

  - TSS = new signing method for consensus output data.
  - Near completion of HIP + core libraries.
  - Needs to move from Hedera repo to Hiero, given its critical role.
  - Process clarified:

    - Submit a **project proposal** in the TSC repo (issue format).
    - Describe project, contributors, state (releases, adoption), and community support.
    - TSC review → vote → onboarding via **Community Project Transition meeting**.

  - Action: Mark to submit proposal; Hendrik/Jessica to support.

---

## Key Decisions

- **HIP Quiescence approved unanimously** by TSC vote.
- **No org split**: All ecosystem projects to be hosted under Hiero Ledger org.
- Graduation work continues; additional data being compiled for LFDT Tech review.

---

## Action Items

- **Jessica**: Continue drafting project onboarding guidelines (include minimum security and governance requirements).
- **Hendrik & Jessica**: Finalize graduation PR updates and present at next LFDT Tech meeting.
- **TSC**: Discuss and finalize maintainer election timeline next week.
- **Mark Blackman**: Draft project proposal for TSS cryptography library; begin transition process.
- **Roger/Andrew**: To support project transition once proposal approved.
