## Summary of the Meeting

The meeting focused on finalizing the transfer status of several Hashgraph-to-Hiero repositories, including SDKs and documentation repos. Attendees then discussed ongoing requirements for HIP submissions: primarily the Sponsored Fees HIP, which centers on enabling third-party fee payment (gas or transaction fees) for end users. The conversation identified open questions about granularity of fee coverage and operational details for partial or overlapping sponsorship scopes. The group agreed that additional refinement is needed before an approval vote. The EVM Address HIP was also briefly mentioned but deferred for further review. Finally, participants acknowledged a new HIP proposal from Mark S., to be on the agenda for the next meeting.

## Detailed Notes

### 1. Approval of Previous Minutes
- The December meeting minutes were **approved** and merged.  
- The minutes from **last week’s meeting** have one remaining approval needed; attendees were encouraged to review and merge the pull request as soon as possible.

### 2. Project Transition Updates
Hendrik presented an updated “transition matrix” covering Hedera/Hashgraph projects being transferred into the Hiero (LF) organization:

- **JavaScript SDK and Local Node** are both scheduled for transfer _this week_.  
- **Swift SDK, Java SDK, and Rust SDK** are next in line for next week; some outstanding tasks (like license checks, DCO sign-offs) remain.  
- **Hedera Docs and the HIPS repository** are planned for transfer in the following 2–3 weeks, pending final license scans and sign-off reviews.  
- The group briefly discussed **Hedera Services**:
  - Services has only one commit that needs DCO sign-off.  
  - License scanning is in progress but appears favorable so far.  
  - The timing for transferring the Services repo depends on clarifying how certain GitHub apps (security checks, CI integrations) will be handled under LF. The target is _within the next few weeks_, though no firm date was set.  

**Open Points / Action Items**  
- Ensure that maintainers review any remaining commits without DCO sign-off and confirm that the content is acceptable.  
- Continue license checks for repositories such as the Rust SDK, Mirror Node, and HIP repos.  
- Coordinate with Linux Foundation to configure GitHub security apps for the Hedera Services repo.

### 3. HIP Updates  

Below is the **condensed** version of the “A. Sponsored Fees HIP” section:

---

### A. Sponsored Fees HIP

- **Goal**: Allow a third party (“sponsor”) to pay fees (transaction fees and/or gas fees) on behalf of another account. Extends the existing allowance system used for tokens/HBAR to cover fees.  
- **Scopes**:
  - Sponsor the gas cost of a contract call.  
  - Sponsor the standard fees of any Hedera API transaction (e.g., file, token, consensus).  
  - Sponsor custom token/NFT fees.  
- **Discussion Points**:
  1. **Use Cases**: Improves usability by removing the upfront requirement to buy HBAR. Commonly used by dApps or companies offering “gasless” user experiences.  
  2. **Granularity**: Sponsors may want fine-grained control or prefer covering *all* fees, but current proposal differentiates gas from standard transaction fees.  
  3. **Multiple Allowances**: Need clear rules when a transaction references multiple scopes (e.g., both gas and transaction fees).  
  4. **Implementation Details**:  
     - Gas is denominated in “gas units” but settled in HBAR.  
     - Records must clearly show who pays which portion of fees.  
     - Possible schema/ETL changes to track sponsored amounts.  
- **Next Steps**:  
  - Further refinement on handling overlapping scopes, failing or ignoring unused scopes, and ensuring sponsor controls align with real-world use cases.  
  - No final vote yet; more discussion and a matrix of scenarios will be added to the HIP before TSC approval.  

---

#### B. EVM Address HIP
- Briefly mentioned but **deferred**:  
  - The HIP proposes allowing direct user assignment of EVM addresses, or another approach to controlling contract addresses.  
  - The TSC opted to remove it from immediate agenda until final updates are ready.  

#### C. Mark’s Proposed New HIP
- Mark joined briefly to mention that he submitted a new HIP after the agenda was posted.  
- It will be **added to next week’s agenda** for an initial review.

---

## Any Other Business / Next Steps

- The TSC and maintainers will continue verifying DCO sign-offs across repositories planned for near-term transfer.  
- **Action Items**:
  1. **Repository Transfers**: Maintain the transition schedule, with JavaScript SDK and Local Node transferring this week, followed by Swift SDK, Java SDK, Rust SDK.  
  2. **HIP Revisions**:  
     - Nana to update Sponsored Fees HIP with more explicit usage scenarios and clarifications on overlapping coverage.  
     - EVM Address HIP remains deferred until all feedback is addressed.  
  3. **Upcoming Agenda**: Mark’s new HIP will be on next week’s meeting for discussion.
