# Hiero Technical Steering Committee Meeting

**TL;DR:** The committee approved updates to the technical charter enabling all core members to vote, discussed improving the project proposal process with clearer maturity and fit criteria, reviewed and deferred voting on the Hedera CLI project until next week pending additional project health details, set staggered TSC election cohorts, and approved two HIPs (precise smart contract throttling and scheduled contract calls).

## Meeting Summary

- **Attendance Tracking Issues:**

  - Ongoing challenges with verifying member participation due to guest logins in PCC tool.
  - Jessica offered to update attendance records if members send current email identities.

- **Charter Update:**

  - Main change: Removal of “active voting member” category—now all core members can vote.
  - Minor cleanup items: removal of outdated file references, consolidation of charter location.
  - Vote held and passed unanimously. Change merged live during meeting.

- **Project Proposal Process Improvements:**

  - Discussion on adding clearer **project maturity** and **fit-for-Hiero** criteria before voting.
  - Suggestions:

    - Include metrics (contributors, releases, recent commits, activity trends).
    - Identify maintainers and governance health.
    - Explain why the project belongs under Hiero.
    - Possibly adopt CNCF Sandbox-style template or checklist.
    - Use OpenSSF Scorecard for baseline health assessment.

  - Diane & Jessica to assist with data gathering for current proposal and create a guideline template.

- **Hedera CLI (Hiero CLI) Proposal:**

  - Presented by Michiel Mulders. CLI tool automates account, token, and contract setup with variable interpolation for streamlined CI/CD use.
  - Supports Hedera services (Consensus, Token, Smart Contracts via Hardhat).
  - Can chain commands to build complex test environments quickly.
  - Proposal to bring tool into Hiero for further development and marketing.
  - Vote deferred to next week pending an updated "state of project" section with usage stats, history, and maintainer details.

- **TSC Election Cohorts:**

  - Richard Bair proposed 2-year staggered term system with balanced representation across maintainer, contributor, and end-user seats.
  - Two permanent seats (Leemon Baird, Alex Popowycz) not part of elections.
  - Cohort assignments approved unanimously. First reelection next month for one maintainer seat.

- **HIP Votes:**

  - Precise Smart Contract Throttling — shift from gas/sec to operation-cost-based throttling for higher throughput.
  - Scheduled Contract Calls — enabling scheduled execution of contract functions.
  - Both approved by majority vote, with one member abstaining from "Scheduled Contract Calls" pending review.

---

## Key Decisions

- Approved and merged charter updates removing active voting member category.
- Adopted a more structured pre-vote project evaluation process (metrics, fit rationale, maintainers).
- Established TSC election cohorts with staggered 2-year terms.
- Approved HIP-Precise Smart Contract Throttling and HIP-Scheduled Contract Calls.
- Deferred vote on Hedera CLI until next meeting pending maturity and usage details.

## Action Items

- **Jessica & Hendrik:** Draft guidelines/checklist for project proposal evaluation, including OpenSSF Scorecard steps.
- **Michiel Mulders:** Update CLI proposal with maturity details (contributors, releases, usage, architecture).
- **Diane:** Pull project health stats from Hashgraph repo for CLI.
- **Hendrik & Jessica:** Plan contributor seat election timeline for next month.
- **All members:** Review updated CLI proposal before next meeting.

## Active TSC member state
Based on charter:
> Any TSC member, including permanent members, that misses three (3) consecutive meetings shall be automatically suspended from eligibility to vote, i.e. no longer considered an active member, until having attended two meetings consecutively. For avoidance of doubt, the suspended TSC member shall be eligible to vote in the second consecutive meeting.
