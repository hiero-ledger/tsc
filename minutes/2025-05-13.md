# Hiero Technical Steering Committee (TSC) Meeting

**TL;DR:** TSC voted to approve HIP-1056 (Block Streams) at the requirements level. Hiero's community governance and voting process is in full swing, with clear guidance on eligibility and participation. A major proposal for extending account programmability—“Hiero Hooks”—was introduced and well-received. The team also reviewed progress toward project graduation under the Linux Foundation.

## Meeting Summary

- **Project Transition**: The transfer of core projects from Hedera to Hiero is complete. Community projects are in the process of onboarding with structured migration tasks.

- **TSC Elections**:
  - Voting is live.
  - 451 eligible contributor voters, 18+ eligible end-user voters.
  - Contributors and adopters can still be added during the election period.
  - Community is encouraged to vote using GitHub-linked credentials.
  - YouTube tutorials were created to assist with the voting process.

- **Graduation Path with Linux Foundation**:
  - Action items created based on feedback from the annual report review.
  - Jessica and Diane are leading graduation tasks, including updates to `MAINTAINERS.md` and reviewing OpenSSF scorecards.
  - A formal graduation request will follow once required items are complete.

- **HIP Process Clarification**:
  - A detailed discussion was held about the meaning and implications of HIP approval.
  - Clarified distinction between approval for specification versus implementation.
  - TSC aims to revise HIP-1 to clarify stages of HIP lifecycle and approval requirements.

- **HIP-1056 (Block Streams)**:
  - Voted and approved at the "requirements" (high-level design) stage.
  - Mark Blackman presented and received positive feedback.
  - Next stage: specification review and implementation alignment.

- **Hiero Hooks HIP (introduced by Michael Tinker)**:
  - Proposed programmable hooks that can be attached to user accounts.
  - First application: customizing logic for approving token allowances.
  - Benefits include enhanced modularity, programmability, and limiting need for HIPs for one-off features.
  - Hooks will be implemented via smart contracts on EVM.
  - Community-led governance via HIPs expected for standard hooks (e.g. anti-dusting).
  - Discussion covered technical design, security concerns, and payment mechanisms for hook execution.

## Key Decisions

- Approval of HIP-1056 requirements-level vote (Block Streams HIP).
- Agreement to continue work on graduation requirements and submit formal graduation request when ready.
- Plan to revisit and clarify HIP process in HIP-1 with defined approval stages.

## Action Items

- Continue onboarding of community projects
- Jessica to maintain voting eligibility lists and update ballots regularly
- Diane and Jessica to co-author formal graduation request document
- Keith to draft HIP process improvements and present to TSC
- TSC to continue Hiero Hooks HIP discussion, focusing next on charging/throttling mechanisms
