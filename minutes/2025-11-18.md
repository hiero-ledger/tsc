# Hiero Technical Steering Committee Meeting

**TL;DR:** Previous minutes were confirmed; two new project proposals (Hiero Contracts repo and Hiero Ethereum Client Spec) were deferred to next week. Sophie Bulloch presented a strong Python SDK Hacktoberfest report (major contributor growth) and proposed training + automation to scale. Keith Kowal previewed an Identity Collaboration Hub concept to centralize identity docs/standards and lightweight code.

## Guests

As every Hiero meeting the TSC meeting is a public meeting and everybody can attend it.  
You can find all the information about the TSC meetings and all other Hiero meetings in our [public calender](https://zoom-lfx.platform.linuxfoundation.org/meetings/hiero).

## Code of Conduct

As in every meeting we start with a short notice of the [antitrust policy of Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/legal/antitrust-policy) and an introduction of our [Code of Conduct](https://www.lfdecentralizedtrust.org/code-of-conduct).

## Meeting Summary

- **Minutes:** Prior minutes already merged; no objections raised.
- **Community update:** Note that Milan attended **DevConnect**; encourage sharing such items earlier so the community can engage.
- **HIPs:** No items for today. Expect incoming HIP activity (e.g., HIP-1313 and others targeting an upcoming release window) in the next meetings.
- **Project proposals:**  
  - **Hiero Contracts Repository** and **Hiero Ethereum Client Spec** were queued but the proposer wasn’t present; both moved to next week.  
  - Michael Kantor’s separate proposal also moved to next week due to a Cloudflare-related incident limiting availability.
- **Python SDK Hacktoberfest (presentation by Sophie Bulloch):**  
  - Activity spiked (~**660%** growth); peak week rose from ~5 to **38** commits; **74** PRs merged in October, **~115** PRs merged over Oct→Nov; ~**40** new contributors, largely CS students/grads.  
  - **What worked:** clear “good first issue” labeling; strong templates & examples; rapid, informative maintainer feedback.  
  - **Gaps/needs:** contributors advancing beyond easy issues need **Hiero-specific internals training** (transactions, consensus, protobuf/serialization, client patterns). Maintainer time doesn’t scale linearly.  
  - **Proposed remedies:**  
    - Training: short video series / webinars (LFDT meetups possible), contributor-focused “SDK internals” materials; leverage LFDT Training & Certification once content exists.  
    - **Automation:** bots for DCO/signing and failed-check guidance; CI to run example scripts; tooling to diff protobufs vs SDK surface to flag missing methods; generate “good first issue+” items.  
  - **Follow-ons:** Hashgraph team suggested exploring **TCK coverage** extension to Python SDK as its importance grows for AI & data workloads.
- **Identity Collaboration Hub (preview by Keith Kowal):**  
  - Proposal for an **umbrella repo** to centralize identity architecture docs, standards (folding the previously approved Identity Standards repo), discussions, and **non-dependency demo/snippet code** (i.e., items that don’t warrant stand-alone projects or TSC approval).  
  - Items that become dependencies (SDKs, libraries) remain separate and under normal governance. Some parts would still be governed via HIPS.  
  - Discussion to continue next week; issue was posted during the meeting.

---

## Presentations

- **Python SDK Hacktoberfest Retrospective — Sophie Bulloch**  
  - Growth metrics, contributor personas, and repeatable playbook (issue labeling, docs, feedback loops).  
  - Concrete automation prototypes (DCO/signing checks, CI nudges, example runners, protobuf-driven surface analysis).  
  - Call for TSC/community support on training content and scaling maintainer capacity.

---

## Key Decisions

- Prior minutes considered **approved** (already merged).
- **Deferrals to next week:**  
  - Hiero Contracts Repository proposal  
  - Hiero Ethereum Client Spec proposal  
  - Michael Kantor’s project proposal  
  - Identity Collaboration Hub discussion & potential vote

---

## Action Items

- **Hendrik**: Add deferred proposals (Contracts repo, Ethereum Client Spec, Michael’s proposal) and **Identity Collaboration Hub** to **next week’s** TSC agenda; include Jessica’s new wiki/agenda page.  
- **Sophie**: Coordinate with LFDT (via Jessica/Diane) on options to present at Tech/TSC/Maintainer Days and to scope contributor-focused training content.  
- **Hashgraph SDK leads**: Evaluate feasibility/timeline for expanding **TCK coverage** to the Python SDK.  
- **All**: Review and comment on the Identity Collaboration Hub issue before next meeting.
