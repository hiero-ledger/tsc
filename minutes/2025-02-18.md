## Key Decisions and Discussion Points

- Meeting Minutes: Retain the two-approval process to ensure thorough review despite available recording. Create high level "meeting summaries" going forward focused on discussion points and action items vs full meeting minutes. Action: Hendrik will add a PR note clarifying any missing details, Brandon will change format.
- Hedera and Hiero Vision: Agree on a structured presentation of HIPS aligned with strategic goals. Action: Leemon Baird will prepare and present insights on the long-term vision.
- Project Transition: Key projects are migrating from Hashgraph to Hiero this week. Action: Roger will coordinate the migration with project maintainers.
- Daily Rewards HIP: Approved with clarified prorating mechanics; to be implemented with flexible configuration.
- Hiero Project Criteria: Adopt initial guidelines based on impact, technical integration, and security. Action: Document and use these criteria for future evaluations.
- TSC Voting: Further review needed with input from Linux Foundation contacts. Action: Diane and Jessica will reach out to the key contacts.
- SDK Template: Ongoing discussion and PR review for the new design template; feedback requested. Action: Members should review and provide input.
- GitHub Task Lists: Evaluate migration from deprecated task lists to proper sub-issues. Action: Jessica will contact GitHub and Roger will explore a migration script.
- Polling App Demo: A demo for a Hedera-based polling app was agreed upon. Action: Mark Blackman will add the demo to the agenda and prepare it.
